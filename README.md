	@NgModule({
	    imports: [ PinchZoomModule ]
	})

## Usage
For use, put your image inside the &lt;pinch-zoom&gt; container. Please, pay attention to the parameters of your viewport metatag. If you use Pinch Zoom, it is required to limit zooming of a web-page, by entering the following parameters: &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"&gt;.

	<pinch-zoom>
	    <img src="path_to_image" /> 
	</pinch-zoom>
